       "{'Roger Apéry': 'Roger Apéry (French: [apeʁi]; 14 November 1916, Rouen – 18 December 1994, Caen) was a Greek-French mathematician most remembered for Apéry\\'s theorem, which states that ζ(3) is an irrational number. Here, ζ(s) denotes the Riemann zeta function.== Biography ==Apéry was born in Rouen in 1916 to a French mother and Greek father. His childhood was spent in Lille until 1926, when the family moved to Paris, where he studied at the Lycée Ledru-Rollin and the Lycée Louis-le-Grand.  He was admitted  at the École normale supérieure in 1935.  His studies were interrupted at the start of World War II; he was mobilized in September 1939, taken prisoner of war in June 1940, repatriated with pleurisy in June 1941, and hospitalized until August 1941. He wrote his doctoral thesis in algebraic geometry under the direction of Paul Dubreil and René Garnier in 1947.In 1947 Apéry was appointed Maître de conférences (lecturer) at the University of Rennes. In 1949 he was appointed Professor at the University of Caen, where he remained until his retirement.In 1979 he published an unexpected proof of the irrationality of ζ(3), which is the sum of the inverses of the cubes of the positive integers. An indication of the difficulty is that the corresponding problem for other odd powers remains unsolved. Nevertheless, many mathematicians have since worked on the so-called Apéry sequences to seek alternative proofs that might apply to other odd powers (Frits Beukers, Alfred van der Poorten, Marc Prévost, Keith Ball, Tanguy Rivoal, Wadim Zudilin, and others).Apéry was active in politics and for a few years in the 1960s was president of the Calvados Radical Party of the Left. He abandoned politics after the reforms instituted by Edgar Faure after the 1968 revolt, when he realised that university life was running against the tradition he had always upheld.== Personal life ==Apéry married in 1947 and had three sons, including mathematician François Apéry. His first marriage ended in divorce in 1971. He then remarried in 1972 and divorced in 1977.In 1994, Apéry died from Parkinson\\'s disease after a long illness in Caen. He was buried next to his parents at the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. His tombstone has a mathematical inscription stating his theorem.                    1        +                              1            8                          +                              1            27                          +                              1            64                          +        ⋯        ≠                              p            q                                {\\\\displaystyle 1+{\\\\frac {1}{8}}+{\\\\frac {1}{27}}+{\\\\frac {1}{64}}+\\\\cdots \\\\neq {\\\\frac {p}{q}}}  == See also ==Apéry\\'s constantBasel problem== External links ==Apéry, François (1996). \"Roger Apéry, 1916-1994: A Radical Mathematician\".

       " 'Owen Richardson': 'Sir Owen Willans Richardson (26 April 1879 – 15 February 1959) was an English physicist who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1928 for his work on thermionic emission, which led to Richardson\\'s law.== Biography ==Richardson was born in Dewsbury, Yorkshire, England, the son of Joshua Henry and Charlotte Maria Richardson. He was educated at Batley Grammar School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he gained First Class Honours in Natural Sciences. He then got a DSc from University College London in 1904.After graduating in 1900, he began researching the emission of electricity from hot bodies at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, and in October 1902 he was made a fellow at Trinity. In 1901, he demonstrated that the current from a heated wire seemed to depend exponentially on the temperature of the wire with a mathematical form similar to the Arrhenius equation. This became known as Richardson\\'s law: \"If then the negative radiation is due to the corpuscles coming out of the metal, the saturation current s should obey the law                     s        =        A                          T                      1                          /                        2                                            e                      −            b                          /                        T                                {\\\\displaystyle s=A\\\\,T^{1/2}\\\\,e^{-b/T}}  .\"Richardson was professor at Princeton University from 1906 to 1913, and returned to the UK in 1914 to become Wheatstone Professor of Physics at King\\'s College London, where he was later made director of research in 1924.  In 1927, he was one of the participants of the fifth Solvay Conference on Physics that took place at the International Solvay Institute for Physics in Belgium. He retired from King’s College London in 1944, and died in 1959. He is buried in Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey.He also researched the photoelectric effect, the gyromagnetic effect, the emission of electrons by chemical reactions, soft X-rays, and the spectrum of hydrogen.Richardson married Lilian Wilson, sister of his Cavendish colleague Harold Wilson, in 1906, and had two sons and a daughter. Richardson had two sisters. Elizabeth Mary Dixon Richardson married the prominent mathematician Oswald Veblen. Charlotte Sara Richardson married the American physicist (and 1937 Nobel laureate) Clinton Davisson, who was Richardson\\'s PhD student at Princeton. After Lilian\\'s death in 1945, he was remarried in 1948 to Henriette Rupp, a physicist.Owen Willans Richardson had a son, Harold Owen Richardson, who specialised in Nuclear Physics and was also the chairman of the Physics Department at Bedford College, London University and later on became emeritus professor at London University.== Honours ==Richardson was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1910. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1913, and was awarded its Hughes Medal in 1920. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1928, \"for his work on the thermionic phenomenon and especially for the discovery of the law named after him\".

       " 'Otto Sackur': \"Otto Sackur (28 September 1880 in Breslau, Germany – 17 December 1914 in Berlin, Germany) was a German physical chemist.He is known for the development of the Sackur–Tetrode equation, which he developed independently of Hugo Tetrode. His and Tetrode's names are also combined to name the Sackur–Tetrode constant derived using the equation.Sackur studied at the University of Breslau, receiving his doctorate there in 1901 under Richard Abegg. He received his Habilitation in 1905 under Richard Abegg. He then worked in London before joining the Fritz Haber Institute in Berlin, becoming the head of the physical chemistry department early 1914. He had good relations with Clara Immerwahr. They studied as doctoral students together, and Immerwahr was the one who got him the job in the Institute.After the outbreak of WWI, he was enlisted for military research, and during his free time he carried out experiments on the behavior of gases at low temperatures. During experiments on chemical warfare, he mixed a beaker of dichloromethylamine mixed with cacodyl chloride, and while observing it at eye level, it exploded. The explosion was so powerful that it killed him on site; even Gerhard Leopold Just (1877-1948), an assistant to Haber, lost his right hand in the explosion while trying to save Otto by snatching the exploding beaker.Haber, Just, and Sackur were back then researching on improvements to the T-Shell, with the aim of finding some chemical that could serve both as an explosive and an irritant. Cacodyl chloride, first synthesized by Robert Bunsen in 1837, fit the description. Indeed, it had scarcely been researched since its discovery precisely because it is highly irritating and explosive.== References ==== External links ==Works by or about Otto Sackur at the Internet Archive\",\n",
       " 'Ludvig Lorenz': 'Ludvig Valentin Lorenz ( LORR-ənts; 18 January 1829 – 9 June 1891) was a Danish physicist and mathematician. In 1867, he gave completely general integral solutions to the differential equations of electromagnetism, which contain retardation effects reflecting the finite speed of light. This paper also introduces the Lorenz gauge, named after him.Lorenz also developed mathematical formulae to describe phenomena such as the relation between the refraction of light and the density of a pure transparent substance, and the relation between a metal\\'s electrical and thermal conductivity and temperature (Wiedemann–Franz–Lorenz law).History has not been kind to Lorenz. His name is often confused with that of Hendrik Antoon Lorentz, who is incorrectly credited forhis (Lorenz\\'s) work.== Biography ==Lorenz was born in Helsingør and studied at the Technical University in Copenhagen. He became professor at the Military Academy in Copenhagen 1876. From 1887, his research was funded by the Carlsberg Foundation.== Work ==Lorenz\\'s greatest contribution (1867) is a development of general integral solutions to the differential equations of electromagnetism, which contain retardation effects reflecting the finite speed of light. This paper also introduces the Lorenz gauge, named after him. His 1867 paper can be regarded as contemporaneous with Maxwell\\'s identification of light with electromagnetism waves (1865).The Lorenz gauge hence contradicted Maxwell\\'s original derivation of the EM wave equation by introducing a retardation effect to the Coulomb force and bringing it inside the EM wave equation alongside the time varying electric field, which was introduced in Lorenz\\'s paper \"On the identity of the vibrations of light with electrical currents\". Lorenz\\'s work was the first use of symmetry to simplify Maxwell\\'s equations after Maxwell himself published his 1865 paper. Lorenz also investigated the mathematical description for light propagation through a single homogeneous medium and described the passage of light between different media. The formula for the mathematical relationship between the refractive index and the density of a medium was published by Lorenz in 1869 and by Hendrik Lorentz (who discovered it independently) in 1878 and is therefore called the Lorentz–Lorenz equation or the Lorenz-Lorentz equation which preserves the historical order. Using his electromagnetic theory of light he stated what is known as the Lorenz gauge condition, and was able to derive a correct value for the velocity of light. He also developed a theory of light scattering, publishing it in Danish in 1890 and in French in his Collected Works, published in 1898. It was later independently rediscovered by Gustav Mie in 1908, so it is sometimes referred to as Lorenz–Mie theory. Additionally, Lorenz laid the foundations for ellipsometry by using Fresnel\\'s theory of refraction to discover that light reflected by a thin transition layer between two media becomes elliptically polarized.== References ==Lorenz, L.

       " 'Henri Victor Regnault': \"Henri Victor Regnault  (21 July 1810 – 19 January 1878) was a French chemist and physicist best known for his careful measurements of the thermal properties of gases. He was an early thermodynamicist and was mentor to William Thomson in the late 1840s. He never used his first given name, and was known throughout his lifetime as Victor Regnault.== Biography ==Born in Aix-la-Chapelle in 1810 (modern Aachen, Germany and at that time under French rule), he moved to Paris at the age of eight, following the death of his parents.  There, he worked for an upholstery firm until he was eighteen.  In 1830, he was admitted to the École Polytechnique, and in 1832 he graduated from the École des mines.Working under Justus von Liebig at Gießen, Regnault distinguished himself in the nascent field of organic chemistry by synthesizing several chlorinated hydrocarbons (e.g. vinyl chloride in 1835, dichloromethane and perchloroethylene in 1839, 1,1,1-Trichloroethane in 1838 or 1840), and he was appointed professor of chemistry at the University of Lyon.  In 1840, he was appointed the chair of chemistry of the École Polytechnique, and in 1841, he became a professor of physics in the Collège de France.Beginning in 1843, he began compiling extensive numerical tables on the properties of steam. These were published in 1847, and inspired Charles Algernon Parsons to develop the steam turbine. Regnault received the Rumford Medal of the Royal Society of London and appointment as Chief Engineer of Mines. In 1851 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1854 he was appointed director of the porcelain works at Sèvres, the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres. In 1855, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.At Sèvres, he continued work on the thermal properties of matter.  He designed sensitive thermometers, hygrometers, hypsometers and calorimeters, and measured the specific heats of many substances and the coefficient of thermal expansion of gases.  In the course of this work, he discovered that not all gases expand equally when heated and that Boyle's law is only an approximation, especially at temperatures near a substance's boiling point.Regnault was also an avid amateur photographer.  He introduced the use of pyrogallic acid as a developing agent, and was one of the first photographers to use paper negatives.  In 1854, he became the founding president of the Société française de photographie.In 1871, his laboratory at Sèvres was destroyed and his son Alex-Georges-Henri Regnault killed, both as a result of the Franco-Prussian War.  He retired from science the next year, never recovering from these losses.== Legacy ==The crater Regnault on the Moon is named after Regnault, and his name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.  Some have suggested that the symbol R for the ideal gas constant is also named after him.He was the first president of Société française de photographie.The French Lagrange-class submarine Regnault, built between 1913 and 1924 was named for him.== Works ==Regnault-Strecker's kurzes Lehrbuch der Chemie.

His childhood was spent in Lille until 1926, when the family moved to Paris, where he studied at the Lycée Ledru-Rollin and the Lycée Louis-le-Grand.  He was admitted  at the École normale supérieure in 1935.  His studies were interrupted at the start of World War II; he was mobilized in September 1939, taken prisoner of war in June 1940, repatriated with pleurisy in June 1941, and hospitalized until August 1941. He wrote his doctoral thesis in algebraic geometry under the direction of Paul Dubreil and René Garnier in 1947.In 1947 Apéry was appointed Maître de conférences (lecturer) at the University of Rennes. In 1949 he was appointed Professor at the University of Caen, where he remained until his retirement.In 1979 he published an unexpected proof of the irrationality of ζ(3), which is the sum of the inverses of the cubes of the positive integers. An indication of the difficulty is that the corresponding problem for other odd powers remains unsolved. Nevertheless, many mathematicians have since worked on the so-called Apéry sequences to seek alternative proofs that might apply to other odd powers (Frits Beukers, Alfred van der Poorten, Marc Prévost, Keith Ball, Tanguy Rivoal, Wadim Zudilin, and others).Apéry was active in politics and for a few years in the 1960s was president of the Calvados Radical Party of the Left. He abandoned politics after the reforms instituted by Edgar Faure after the 1968 revolt, when he realised that university life was running against the tradition he had always upheld.== Personal life ==Apéry married in 1947 and had three sons, including mathematician François Apéry. His first marriage ended in divorce in 1971. He then remarried in 1972 and divorced in 1977.In 1994, Apéry died from Parkinson\\'s disease after a long illness in Caen.

In 1927, he was one of the participants of the fifth Solvay Conference on Physics that took place at the International Solvay Institute for Physics in Belgium. He retired from King’s College London in 1944, and died in 1959. He is buried in Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey.He also researched the photoelectric effect, the gyromagnetic effect, the emission of electrons by chemical reactions, soft X-rays, and the spectrum of hydrogen.Richardson married Lilian Wilson, sister of his Cavendish colleague Harold Wilson, in 1906, and had two sons and a daughter. Richardson had two sisters. Elizabeth Mary Dixon Richardson married the prominent mathematician Oswald Veblen. Charlotte Sara Richardson married the American physicist (and 1937 Nobel laureate) Clinton Davisson, who was Richardson\\'s PhD student at Princeton. After Lilian\\'s death in 1945, he was remarried in 1948 to Henriette Rupp, a physicist.Owen Willans Richardson had a son, Harold Owen Richardson, who specialised in Nuclear Physics and was also the chairman of the Physics Department at Bedford College, London University and later on became emeritus professor at London University.== Honours ==Richardson was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1910.

His and Tetrode's names are also combined to name the Sackur–Tetrode constant derived using the equation.Sackur studied at the University of Breslau, receiving his doctorate there in 1901 under Richard Abegg. He received his Habilitation in 1905 under Richard Abegg. He then worked in London before joining the Fritz Haber Institute in Berlin, becoming the head of the physical chemistry department early 1914. He had good relations with Clara Immerwahr. They studied as doctoral students together, and Immerwahr was the one who got him the job in the Institute.After the outbreak of WWI, he was enlisted for military research, and during his free time he carried out experiments on the behavior of gases at low temperatures. During experiments on chemical warfare, he mixed a beaker of dichloromethylamine mixed with cacodyl chloride, and while observing it at eye level, it exploded. The explosion was so powerful that it killed him on site; even Gerhard Leopold Just (1877-1948), an assistant to Haber, lost his right hand in the explosion while trying to save Otto by snatching the exploding beaker.Haber, Just, and Sackur were back then researching on improvements to the T-Shell, with the aim of finding some chemical that could serve both as an explosive and an irritant. Cacodyl chloride, first synthesized by Robert Bunsen in 1837, fit the description. Indeed, it had scarcely been researched since its discovery precisely because it is highly irritating and explosive.== References ==== External links ==Works by or about Otto Sackur at the Internet Archive\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Ludvig Lorenz'}, page_content='Ludvig Valentin Lorenz ( LORR-ənts; 18 January 1829 – 9 June 1891) was a Danish physicist and mathematician. In 1867, he gave completely general integral solutions to the differential equations of electromagnetism, which contain retardation effects reflecting the finite speed of light. This paper also introduces the Lorenz gauge, named after him.Lorenz also developed mathematical formulae to describe phenomena such as the relation between the refraction of light and the density of a pure transparent substance, and the relation between a metal\\'s electrical and thermal conductivity and temperature (Wiedemann–Franz–Lorenz law).History has not been kind to Lorenz. His name is often confused with that of Hendrik Antoon Lorentz, who is incorrectly credited forhis (Lorenz\\'s) work.== Biography ==Lorenz was born in Helsingør and studied at the Technical University in Copenhagen. He became professor at the Military Academy in Copenhagen 1876. From 1887, his research was funded by the Carlsberg Foundation.== Work ==Lorenz\\'s greatest contribution (1867) is a development of general integral solutions to the differential equations of electromagnetism, which contain retardation effects reflecting the finite speed of light. This paper also introduces the Lorenz gauge, named after him. His 1867 paper can be regarded as contemporaneous with Maxwell\\'s identification of light with electromagnetism waves (1865).The Lorenz gauge hence contradicted Maxwell\\'s original derivation of the EM wave equation by introducing a retardation effect to the Coulomb force and bringing it inside the EM wave equation alongside the time varying electric field, which was introduced in Lorenz\\'s paper \"On the identity of the vibrations of light with electrical currents\". Lorenz\\'s work was the first use of symmetry to simplify Maxwell\\'s equations after Maxwell himself published his 1865 paper. Lorenz also investigated the mathematical description for light propagation through a single homogeneous medium and described the passage of light between different media. The formula for the mathematical relationship between the refractive index and the density of a medium was published by Lorenz in 1869 and by Hendrik Lorentz (who discovered it independently) in 1878 and is therefore called the Lorentz–Lorenz equation or the Lorenz-Lorentz equation which preserves the historical order. Using his electromagnetic theory of light he stated what is known as the Lorenz gauge condition, and was able to derive a correct value for the velocity of light. He also developed a theory of light scattering, publishing it in Danish in 1890 and in French in his Collected Works, published in 1898. It was later independently rediscovered by Gustav Mie in 1908, so it is sometimes referred to as Lorenz–Mie theory. Additionally, Lorenz laid the foundations for ellipsometry by using Fresnel\\'s theory of refraction to discover that light reflected by a thin transition layer between two media becomes elliptically polarized.== References ==Lorenz, L.

He was an early thermodynamicist and was mentor to William Thomson in the late 1840s. He never used his first given name, and was known throughout his lifetime as Victor Regnault.== Biography ==Born in Aix-la-Chapelle in 1810 (modern Aachen, Germany and at that time under French rule), he moved to Paris at the age of eight, following the death of his parents.  There, he worked for an upholstery firm until he was eighteen.  In 1830, he was admitted to the École Polytechnique, and in 1832 he graduated from the École des mines.Working under Justus von Liebig at Gießen, Regnault distinguished himself in the nascent field of organic chemistry by synthesizing several chlorinated hydrocarbons (e.g. vinyl chloride in 1835, dichloromethane and perchloroethylene in 1839, 1,1,1-Trichloroethane in 1838 or 1840), and he was appointed professor of chemistry at the University of Lyon.  In 1840, he was appointed the chair of chemistry of the École Polytechnique, and in 1841, he became a professor of physics in the Collège de France.Beginning in 1843, he began compiling extensive numerical tables on the properties of steam. These were published in 1847, and inspired Charles Algernon Parsons to develop the steam turbine. Regnault received the Rumford Medal of the Royal Society of London and appointment as Chief Engineer of Mines. In 1851 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1854 he was appointed director of the porcelain works at Sèvres, the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres. In 1855, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.At Sèvres, he continued work on the thermal properties of matter.  He designed sensitive thermometers, hygrometers, hypsometers and calorimeters, and measured the specific heats of many substances and the coefficient of thermal expansion of gases.  In the course of this work, he discovered that not all gases expand equally when heated and that Boyle's law is only an approximation, especially at temperatures near a substance's boiling point.Regnault was also an avid amateur photographer.  He introduced the use of pyrogallic acid as a developing agent, and was one of the first photographers to use paper negatives.  In 1854, he became the founding president of the Société française de photographie.In 1871, his laboratory at Sèvres was destroyed and his son Alex-Georges-Henri Regnault killed, both as a result of the Franco-Prussian War.  He retired from science the next year, never recovering from these losses.== Legacy ==The crater Regnault on the Moon is named after Regnault, and his name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.  Some have suggested that the symbol R for the ideal gas constant is also named after him.He was the first president of Société française de photographie.The French Lagrange-class submarine Regnault, built between 1913 and 1924 was named for him.== Works ==Regnault-Strecker's kurzes Lehrbuch der Chemie.

His childhood was spent in Lille until 1926, when the family moved to Paris, where he studied at the Lycée Ledru-Rollin and the Lycée Louis-le-Grand\n",

      ". He abandoned politics after the reforms instituted by Edgar Faure after the 1968 revolt, when he realised that university life was running against the tradition he had always upheld.== Personal life ==Apéry married in 1947 and had three sons, including mathematician François Apéry. His first marriage ended in divorce in 1971. He then remarried in 1972 and divorced in 1977.In 1994, Apéry died from Parkinson's disease after a long illness in Caen\n",

      ".  He was admitted  at the École normale supérieure in 1935.  His studies were interrupted at the start of World War II; he was mobilized in September 1939, taken prisoner of war in June 1940, repatriated with pleurisy in June 1941, and hospitalized until August 1941. He wrote his doctoral thesis in algebraic geometry under the direction of Paul Dubreil and René Garnier in 1947.In 1947 Apéry was appointed Maître de conférences (lecturer) at the University of Rennes\n",

Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: {{authorized_imports}}\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up! You\\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!',\n",
